-- First check out the 22-superdirt-midi.sc worksheet
-- There's some code you need to run in SuperCollider

-- Once you've done that you can use CC's in to tidal:

d1 $ sound "arpy*8" # speed (cF 1 "12")

-- In the above line of code '1' is the midi channel and '12' is the CC number
-- Don't forget tidal starts counting MIDI channels at 0 ;)
